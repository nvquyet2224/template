    <p>The monkey-rope is found is all whalers; but it was only in the Peqoud that
        the
        monkey and his holder were ever tied together. This improvement upon the
        original usage was introduced by no less a man than Stubb, in order to
        afford
        the imperilled harpooneer the strongest possible guarantee for the
        faithfulness
        and vigilance of his monkey-rope holder
